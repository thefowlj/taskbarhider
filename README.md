# taskbarhider

Small C++ program to hide/show the Windows Taskbar using the Windows API. It simply toggles between showing the taskbar or not and attempts to work against multiple monitors.

Seemed to work consistently with Windows 7 and 10. Windows 11 seems to try and recover the main monitor taskbar automatically (as of testing March 2024).
